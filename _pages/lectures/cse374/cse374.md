## Week 1
### Installation and setups

- VM set up
- Create a git branch
  - `git checkout -b <ID-week1>`
  - Which is a shorthand for:
  ```sh
  git branch <ID-week1>
  git checkout <ID-week1>
  ```
  - add / commit and push
  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "MESSAGE"
  git push origin <ID-week1>
  ```
  - Open a (draft) merge request on Gitlab to merge your branch into `main` branch.

### Shell basics
  
- `ls`
  - list files in current directory
- `pwd`
  - print working directory
- `cd`
  - change working directory
  - `.` means current directory
  - `..` means parent directory
    - ex) `cd ../..`
  - with no argument: move to user's home directory
- `cat`
  - w/ one argument: `cat FILENAME` - print the contents
  - w/o argument: read from stdin and print to stdout
- `less`
  - shell file viewer
  - w/ one argument: view the file
    - use arrow keys to scroll up/down
    - `q` to quit
    - `/` to search by words
    - `h` for help

### More on shell commands

- `#` is the comment character in the shell
- `echo`: takes arguments and prints(echos) them out
- `man`
  - takes a command name as an argument
    - ex) `man ls`
  - opens up a less viewer to read the manual about the command
- `cp`: copies files
  - takes two arguments: source and destination
    - ex) `cp A B` makes a new filed called `B` with the same contents as `A`
- `mv`: moves(renames) files
  - takes two arguments: source and destination
- `nano`: opens up a shell editor to edit files in terminal (kind ver. of Vim)
  - one argument: file to edit
  - in `nano`, `^O`(`Ctrl-O`) to save
  - `^X` to quit
- `wc`: word counter
  - takes file name as an argument
  - if no file name is given, it uses `stdin`
  - reports line numbers, words, and characters in the file(or input)
- redirection
  - if a command contains `> file`, the when the command prints to stdout, the output is redirected to `file` instead
    - ex) `ls > file` -> make a file with the output of `ls` command
  - `< files` works the other way, it reads the given file and prints it to the terminal
- pipelines
  - combine two commands by sending the output of one into the input of the other
    - ex) `ls | wc` counts lines, words, characters of the output of `ls` command
